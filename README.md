Semi-Supervised-Learning-on-CIFAR10

This project implements a semi-supervised learning approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The implementation uses self-supervised techniques to effectively leverage unlabeled data as part of the training process.

Overview

This repository contains the main Python script, ssl_cifar.py, which orchestrates the semi-supervised learning workflow. The script includes:

Data preprocessing and augmentation techniques.
Model definition and custom training loops.
Integration of self-supervised learning components alongside traditional supervised fine-tuning.
Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have installed the necessary Python libraries. Dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Semi-Supervised-Learning-on-CIFAR10.git
cd Semi-Supervised-Learning-on-CIFAR10


Install dependencies:

Use pip to install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Project

To execute the project, simply run the Python script:

python ssl_cifar.py


Ensure that you have an appropriate runtime environment configured. If you're running on a machine like Google Colab with GPU support (preferably an A100 GPU for optimal performance), set the runtime to use a GPU.

Project Structure
ssl_cifar.py: The main Python script that contains the implementation of the semi-supervised learning pipeline.
